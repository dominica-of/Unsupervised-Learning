# Unsupervised Learning Tutorial - Iris Dataset

This tutorial is a beginner-friendly introduction to the concepts of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering, using the famous Iris dataset.

## Libraries Used

1. **pandas**: for data handling.
2. **matplotlib**: for plotting and visualization.
3. **sklearn**: for machine learning methods and data manipulation.

## Steps

1. **Load the Iris dataset**: The Iris dataset comes built-in with sklearn datasets.

2. **Standardize the feature matrix**: It's a good practice to standardize your data before applying machine learning algorithms. Standardization involves scaling your data so that it has mean 0 and variance 1.

3. **Apply PCA**: PCA is a dimension reduction technique that is widely used in practice. It's an unsupervised method, meaning it finds a new set of dimensions (or a subset of dimensions) that captures the most variance in your data.

4. **Create a DataFrame for the principal components**: For convenience, we place our principal components into a new pandas DataFrame.

5. **Apply K-Means**: K-Means is a simple, yet effective, clustering algorithm that is widely used in practice. It is also an unsupervised method, meaning it seeks to find clusters in the data without reference to any labels.

6. **Add labels to the DataFrame**: We add our K-means labels to the DataFrame for further inspection and analysis.

7. **Visualize clusters**: We use a scatter plot to visualize our clusters in the principal component space.

8. **Determine optimal number of clusters using the elbow method**: One challenge with K-Means is determining the number of clusters. One technique is the elbow method. This involves plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use.

## Note

This tutorial is a simple demonstration of the steps involved in PCA and K-means clustering. For real-world datasets, the exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and preprocessing steps would be much more complex.
